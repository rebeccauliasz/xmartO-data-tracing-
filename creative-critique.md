# Creative Critique 

In response to the idea of "taking ownership of the data", the problematic here is that the data that is collected is sensitive information that those who are targeted (pressumably) have no idea that they are broadcasting. Sites like Insecam and Shodan, in trying to stand in as missionaries, actually make it even easier to access vulnerabilities in an organized way. Likewise, the public tool released Qualys automates an attack in order to prove that the vulnerabilities are an issue, but in doing so give public access to the tool needed to carry out the attack. It could be argued that cyber criminals will always find vulnerabilites within a system anyway, and drawing public attention evens out the playing field in a way. However, it is important to note that these are very real people, in very real homes who have no idea that they are serving as martyrs for the cause...

"Bringing something to attention" can be done in many ways, one of which could be artistic or creative intervention. I propose an interactive media artwork that would aim to bring this nuanced topic into consideration. 

Because some of the information is very immediately accessible by anyone with internet access, it is imporant for this artwork to only use what is available, without any further hacking or weakening of any individual's personal security system. While the data that is easily revealed just by visiting the interface is commensurable, most immediately shocking to me is the live feed of the cameras. On my laptop screen, I have livestreamed access to the most intimate of personal spaces within a home. I have come across bedrooms, living rooms, even a few baby cribs... 

There is something that differentiates this live information from the static content such as IP, location, name etc. in the type of information that could be learned here. Not credit card number but perhaps work schedule, bed time, vacation week etc. Behavior has the ability to be traced and quantized if these streams are processed computationally with computer vision. Information can be extrapolated in extreme and unprecidented ways in a way that could potentially create a complete data set of a person. 

So, in this process of "bringing attention to," identity is at stake. While there is no evidence that this process of computer vision applied to illicitly accessed video streams is actually applied, we can imagine some kind of dystopic system of control in which is was government sactioned. In this hypothetical model, specific algorithms might be utilized to track human presence (ie when is a human in the stream?) and analyze different types of behavior in terms of the way the person engages with their surroundings. I propose to use similar algorithms for precisely the opposite. This hypothetical work would access a range of vulnerable streams and use the same types of computer vision algorithms to search for and **remove** humans from the streams in real time. The process would not be seamless and would leave artifacts of evidence that some type of computational process was happening, yet the viewer would never be able to see the actual human on the other side of the IP camera. Visually,the areas the human occupies would appear distorted, based on a process where the computer is picking out adjacent pixels that are *not human* and trying to recreate what the background behind the human might look like, frame by frame. This stream would be projected on a large body sized screen. Some type of IR sensor would detect when there was a human viewer in front of the screen, and find a stream in which a human was also present (altough their presence would be obscured artificially). When no view was present, the screen would depict empty live streamed spaces. 

There is definitely an issue of privacy still present here. Perhaps the benefit of raising awareness outweights the disregard for privacy if identity is protected? Perhaps it is not my place to act as missionary in the way that Insecam is proposing? 

Technically, the set up would include and arduino with an IR sensor to detect viewer presence. It would use a SimpleMessageSystem library to communicate the serial reading to Max/MSP, where the stream import and stream processing would take place.
