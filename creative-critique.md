# Creative Critique 

In response to the idea of "taking ownership of the data", the problematic here is that the data that is collected is sensitive information that those who are targeted (pressumably) have no idea that they are broadcasting. Sites like Insecam and Shodan, in trying to stand in as missionaries, actually make it even easier to access vulnerabilities in an organized way. Likewise, the public tool released Qualys automates an attack in order to prove that the vulnerabilities are an issue, but in doing so give public access to the tool needed to carry out the attack. It could be argued that cyber criminals will always find vulnerabilites within a system anyway, and drawing public attention evens out the playing field in a way. However, it is important to note that these are very real people, in very real homes who have no idea that they are serving as martyrs for the cause...
